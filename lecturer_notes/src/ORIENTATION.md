Rust is a programming language designed to be safe, concurrent, and practical. It is a systems programming language that runs blazingly fast, prevents segfaults, and guarantees thread safety. Rust is also memory-efficient: it uses minimal memory, making it ideal for embedded systems.

Rust started off as a side project of Mozilla employee Graydon Hoare in 2006. Mozilla saw the potential in this programming language and started sponsoring it in 2009. The company used Rust in its experimental browser engine, Servo. The project was officially revealed to the world in 2010.

Since then, Rust has constantly been developing. It has gained a lot of attention and was called a competitor of C language in 2014. Rust 1.0, the first stable version, was released in 2015.

Due to the pandemic and layoffs at Mozilla in 2020, the Servo project was completely canceled. This has caused some concern about the future of Rust, but in February 2021, the Rust Foundation was founded. Thanks to interest from companies like Google, Microsoft, and AWS, Rust has solidified its position as one of the most popular programming languages among developers.


Why learn rust?

Rust is new, but it is rapidly becoming a popular language. It's user base is growing quite
rapidly. Many think it will soon rise to the top of the most popular languages. It is also the most loved language for the 5th year in a row.

Why do people like rust?

There are many reasons for Rust’s popularity, but it is primarily the language’s features that made it beloved among developers.Rust has become a common, more modern alternative to C and C++. It is just as fast as these well-known languages, but it offers better memory, type and thread safety.

Rust vs other languages:
Go is fast at runtime but Rust gives even better performance. Both languages give similar safety by design: Golang uses a garbage collector, while Rust uses ownership and borrowing to handle memory management. Rust is also safe from data races, which Golang resolves through message passing. While Golang has a lower performance due to the garbage collector, Rust’s ownership and borrowing make it faster.

Its speed also makes Rust better than Python for projects that require low-level control and high performance.
You can do anything with rust from write an operating sysem, to a web server or a front-end web app.


Companies that use rust:

Firefox — Mozilla’s browser uses Rust for its CSS engine,
Android — the operating system added Rust support to the Android Open Source Project,
AWS — some of Amazon’s cloud services are built completely in Rust, e.g., Amazon S3, Amazon EC2, and others,
Discord — both the codebase’s client and server sides are coded in Rust,
Figma — the graphic editor’s multiplayer server written in TypeScript was no longer enough, so it was rewritten in Rust.

This is just a small portion of the IT companies using Rust. There are more and more projects written in this language, including the abovementioned Dropbox or Mozilla Firefox. Whether they are rewrites, additional components, or completely new products, Rust is more often than not the technology of choice for many. Google is starting to use rust in some of their projects as well.


A feature of Rust that makes it so beloved among programmers is the safe mode. It detects bugs or memory vulnerabilities at compilation time and provides you with meaningful warnings. It prevents a lot of issues in the later stages of development.

The popularity of Rust guarantees a growing community and a lot of contributions to public repositories. The language is expected to develop further in the coming years.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Some pitfalls:

Rust has a steep learning curve. This is due to the amount of new concepts that Rust introduces, such as ownership, borrowing, lifetimes, and the borrow checker.
Rust is newer, so there are fewer resources available online. This is especially true for more advanced topics.

Rust’s freshness is considered a flaw, but it makes the language more adapted to modern problems. In the era of software-defined everything, Rust answers many needs that other languages couldn’t. For example, Volvo uses this language to explore the concept of software-defined vehicles.

Also, despite the learning curve, Rust can be seen beginner friendly due to it's welcoming community, extremely robust documentation, and one of the most helpful compilers in existence.
Rust is the most well-loved language.

The growing popularity of Rust among developers contributes to the language being easier to use, as there are more resources available each year. If Rust continues to stay this popular for a couple more years, it might become the standard language for many fields. “Rust offers a unique combination of high-level abstractions and low-level control, which makes it well-suited for building safe and performant systems software.” — says Carol Nichols, co-author of “The Rust Programming Language”

Rust is strongly and statically typed.
Rust is a compiled language.
Rust is a safe language.
Rust is both a low-level language and a high-level language.
Rust is an expressions based language.
Rust is a general-purpose language. That means that it is used for a wide variety of applications.
With rust, your imagination is the limit with what you can do with your code.
Rust is a systems programming language.

Rust is a multi-paradigm language. It supports imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming.
Rust is a functional language. That means that functions are first-class citizens. Functions can be passed as arguments to other functions, returned as values from other functions, and assigned to variables. Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.

Rust is an imperative language. That means that it uses statements to change a program's state. Imperative programming is a programming paradigm that uses statements that change a program's state.
Rust is an object-oriented language. That means that it supports object-oriented programming. Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures.

Rust is a procedural language. That means that it supports procedural programming. Procedural programming is a programming paradigm, derived from structured programming, based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

Rust is a distributed language. That means that it supports distributed programming. Distributed programming is a programming paradigm used to write programs that execute across multiple distinct computers simultaneously. It solves problems inherent in network communication such as partial failure and latency. Examples of distributed systems vary from SOA-based systems to massively multiplayer online games to peer-to-peer applications.
