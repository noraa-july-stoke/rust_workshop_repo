There are many methods for Vectors in Rust that are similar to
those for arrays in other programming languages. Let's take a look
at some of them.

pub fn dedup(&mut self):

    Removes consecutive repeated elements in the vector
    according to the PartialEq trait implementation.
    If the vector is sorted, this removes all duplicates.

pub fn sort(&mut self):

    Sorts the vector in-place using the Ord trait implementation,
    an adaptive, iterative merge sort algorithm which is fast
    for almost sorted data that is also stable and not recursive.

pub fn sort_by<F>(&mut self, compare: F):

    Sorts the vector in-place by the given comparison function.

pub fn sort_unstable(&mut self):

    Sorts the slice, but might not preserve the order of equal elements.
    This sort is unstable (i.e., may reorder equal elements), in-place
    (i.e., does not allocate), and O(n * log(n)) worst-case.

pub fn get<I>(&self, index: I) -> Option<&<I as SliceIndex<[T]>>::Output>:

    Returns a reference to an element or subslice depending on the type of index.
    If given a position, returns a reference to the element at that position
    or None if out of bounds.
    If given a range, returns the subslice corresponding to that range, or
    None if out of bounds.

pub fn insert(&mut self, index: usize, element: T):

    Inserts an element at position index within the vector, shifting all elements
    after it to the right.

pub fn is_empty(&self) -> bool:

    Returns true if the vector contains no elements.

pub fn retain<F>(&mut self, f: F):

    Retains only the elements specified by the predicate.

pub fn main() {
    // First, let's declare a mutable vector:

    // Using dedup to remove consecutive repeated elements:

    // Reset the vector and try some other methods:

    // Using sort to sort the vector:

    // Let's reset the vector and try some other methods:

    // Using sort_unstable to sort the vector:


    // Using get to get the element at a certain index:


    // Using insert to insert an element at a certain position:


    // Using is_empty to check if the vector is empty:


    // Using is_empty to check if the vector is empty:

    // Now, let's empty the vector:

    // Should be empty this time around! ðŸ™ƒ


    // Retain vector method:


    // Retain only even numbers


    /*
    Shorthand Vector Initializers:
    In Rust, you can use shorthand syntax to initialize vectors with repetitive values.
    For example, to create a vector of length 5 with the value 0 repeated in each element,
    you can use the following shorthand syntax:
