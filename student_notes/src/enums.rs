/*
Enums in Rust:

Rust has a powerful feature "enum" that represents a type which could be one of several possible variants.
Each variant in an enum can optionally have data associated with it.
*/

/*
Simple enums:

    These are the simplest form of enums, which can be any variant of the enumeration.
*/




/*
Enums with associated data:

    This kind of enum allows us to store data inside each variant.
    This is useful for wrapping multiple types of data into a single type.
*/


/*
Enums with methods:

    Enums can also have methods associated with them.
