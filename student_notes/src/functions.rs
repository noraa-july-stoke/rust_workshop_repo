/*
Functions in Rust:

Rust is an imperative language, which means it has a clear concept of a function: a procedure that can be executed on command.
Functions are declared with the `fn` keyword and can accept arguments and return a value.

/*
Closures in Rust (Anonymous Functions):

Closures are anonymous functions you can save in a variable or pass as arguments to other functions.
They are a core feature of many functional programming languages.
Closures can capture values from their surrounding scope, creating a sort of 'function plus environment'.
