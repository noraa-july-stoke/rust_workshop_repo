Welcome to the loops activity! In this activity, you will be applying what you just learned about loops.
Complete the tasks below to finish the activity. If you get stuck or need a hint, feel free to refer
to the examples in the notes, the rust documentation, or ping me with your question. Good luck!

In the main function of this file, write three different loops, one for each type of loop: loop, while,
and for.

1. For the first loop, print the numbers from ten to one in a countdown. Once the loop reaches ten, print
    "Liftoff! ðŸš€"

2. Use a while loop for the second loop. This time we will be doing fizz buzz. Print the numbers from
   one to one 50. If the number is divisible by three, print "Fizz" instead of the number. If the
   number is divisible by five, print "Buzz" instead of the number. If the number is divisible by both
   three and five, print "FizzBuzz" instead of the number. Otherwise, print the number.

3. Use a for loop for the third loop. Follow these instructions:

Write a for loop that iterates over an array of your favorite foods. Your task is to print each food item one by one.

    a. Declare an array named "favorite_foods" containing at least five of your favorite food items.
    b. Write a for loop that iterates over the elements of the "favorite_foods" array.
    c. Inside the loop, print each food item on a separate line.
    d. Run your program and observe the output, which should display your favorite foods one by one.

    Example Output:
    - Pizza
    - Sushi
    - Chocolate
    - Ice Cream
    - Tacos
