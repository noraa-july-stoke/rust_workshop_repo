/*
Welcome to the if/else activity! In this activity, you will practice using if/else statements in Rust.
Complete the tasks below in the main function to finish the activity. If you get stuck or need a hint,
refer to the examples in the notes, the Rust documentation, or ask for assistance. Good luck!

Task 1:
Write an if/else statement that checks if a number is positive, negative, or zero.
- Declare a variable named "number" and assign it any integer value of your choice.
- Write an if/else statement that checks the value of "number".
- If "number" is positive, print "The number is positive."
- If "number" is negative, print "The number is negative."
- If "number" is zero, print "The number is zero."
- Run your program and observe the output based on the value of "number."

Task 2:
Write an if/else statement that checks if a person is old enough to vote.
- Declare a variable named "age" and assign it any integer value of your choice.
- Write an if/else statement that checks the value of "age".
- If "age" is greater than or equal to 18, print "You are eligible to vote."
- If "age" is less than 18, print "You are not yet eligible to vote."
- Run your program and observe the output based on the value of "age."

Task 3:
Write an if/else statement to determine if a person is eligible for a discount.
- Declare a boolean variable named "is_student" and assign it either true or false.
- Declare an integer variable named "age" and assign it any age value of your choice.
- Write an if/else statement that checks the values of "is_student" and "age".
- If "is_student" is true and "age" is less than or equal to 25, print "You are eligible for a student discount."
- If "is_student" is false and "age" is greater than or equal to 65, print "You are eligible for a senior discount."
- For all other cases, print "You are not eligible for any discount."
- Run your program and observe the output based on the values of "is_student" and "age."

Task 4:
Write an if/else statement to check if a person's username meets certain criteria.
- Declare a string variable named "username" and assign it any username of your choice.
- Write an if/else statement that checks the length of "username".
- If the length of "username" is greater than or equal to 8 characters, print "Username is valid."
- If the length of "username" is less than 8 characters, print "Username is too short."
- Run your program and observe the output based on the value of "username."


Feel free to modify the code or add more if/else statements to practice different conditions. Have fun!
