# Activities directory.

We will be using a different method to run our code in this directory than in the
'notes' directory.

To run your activities:

1. cd into the folder that contains the 'main.rs' file for the activity you want to run.

2. Run the following command:

```bash
rustc main.rs && ./main
```


This compiles your code and then runs the resultant binary called "main" that rust generates for you.

The binaries generated by most of these exercises will be very small and run very quickly, however
you can go ahead and delete the binaries after you have successfully run them if you want to.
