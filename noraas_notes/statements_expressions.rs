/*
From The Docs:
Statements and expressions:
Rust is primarily an expression language. This means that most forms of value-producing
 or effect-causing evaluation are directed by the uniform syntax category of expressions.
 Each kind of expression can typically nest within each other kind of expression, and
 rules for evaluation of expressions involve specifying both the value produced by the
 expression and the order in which its sub-expressions are themselves evaluated.
In contrast, statements serve mostly to contain and explicitly sequence expression evaluation.
